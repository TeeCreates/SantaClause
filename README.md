**JAVASCRIPTMAS!!**

Here's a small styling project for christmas. When running the program you'll see Santa Clause.

I came across **Scrimba's coding challenge** online. This is their day 10 challenge. For more styling exercises you can view their website at https://scrimba.com/home.


To view and run the code: 
1. Clone Reprository
3. npm start

I challenge you to try replicating this Santa Clause as well! 

**Merry Javascriptmas**
